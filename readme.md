# bootstrap.offcanvas

A [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) add-on to create off-canvas styled navigation.

As of Bootstrap 3.2.2, there is no "offcanvas" element - a drawer-like menu that
goes off screen.  This is an add-on to the core Bootstrap framewrk that adds various
`.offcanvas` classes to quickly and easily create the offcanvas component.
