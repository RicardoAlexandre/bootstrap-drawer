# bootstrap.offcanvas

A [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) add-on to create off-canvas styled navigation.

As of Bootstrap 3.2.2, there is no "offcanvas" element - a drawer-like menu that
goes off screen.  This is an add-on to the core Bootstrap framewrk that adds various
`.offcanvas` classes to quickly and easily create the offcanvas component.

**Version:** 0.9.0

## Requirements

*  [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com)
*  [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) (already a Bootstrap dependency)


# WIP

## TODO

* Fix how button is positioned.
* Docs and examples
* Setup github website
* Fix readme
* npm/bower
